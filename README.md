# pre-work-study-guide


## Description

With this project I set out to learn the basics of front-end web development and then use those skills to build a website. The purpose of the website is to act as a revision guide for the skills used while building the website. I learnt what different aspects of website building are and what they do for the website. e.g HTML for text , CSS  for design and Java script for interactive elements.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
