# pre-work-study-guide


## Description

With this project I set out to learn the basics of front-end web development and then use those skills to build a website. The purpose of the website is to act as a revision guide for the skills used while building the website. I learnt what different aspects of website building are and what they do for the website. e.g HTML for text , CSS  for design and Java script for interactive elements.
